![*Fig. 1* A histogram of English word lengths](histogram.png)

```{r read word lengths table, echo=FALSE}
hist <- read.delim("histogram.tsv")
```
```{r find most common word length, echo=FALSE}
most_common <- hist[which.max(hist$Freq),]
```
The most common word length is `r most_common$Length`, with `r most_common$Freq` occurences.
